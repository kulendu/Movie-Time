`Movie-time` 🎥 is a movie review recommendation system that can say whether the review of the movie you wanted to see is positive or negative. 

### HOW CAN IT HELP YOU ? 💁‍♂️
It can basically help you to dicide whether the movie you wanted to watch is good enough to watch or not. Moreover it can save your time by just seeing the review, rather than the primitive method to watch the enitre movie and say is it **good** or **bad**.
